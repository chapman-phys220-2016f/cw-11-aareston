## Specification

**Reminder: We have switched to Python3 officially.**

For each of the following integration methods, discuss together on the white board to understand how they work for solving a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) $$u'(t) = f[t, u(t)]$$ on a discretized grid $(t_0, t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)$ with points $u_k = u(t_k)$ and grid spacing $\Delta t = t_{k+1} - t_k$. Write a notebook ```cw11-integration.ipynb``` that summarizes your conclusions and details what each method is doing.

1. Euler's Method: 
   
   $u_{k+1} = u_k + \Delta t\, f[t_k, u_k]$ 
1. Leapfrog (Midpoint) Method: 
   
   $u_{k+1} = u_{k-1} + 2\Delta t\, f[t_k, u_k]$  
   
   (How do you compute $u_1$?)
1. Heun's (Trapezoid) Method: 
   
   $\tilde{u}_{k+1} = u_k + \Delta t\, f[t_k, u_k]$, 
   
   $u_{k+1} = u_k + (\Delta t/2)(f[t_k, u_k] + f[t_{k+1}, \tilde{u}_{k+1}])$  
   
   (Note the two steps - what is each doing?)
1. 2nd-order Runge-Kutta Method: 
   
   $u_{k+1} = u_k + K_1$, 
   
   $K_1 = \Delta t\, f[t_k, u_k]$, 
   
   $K_2 = \Delta t\, f[t_k + \Delta t/2, u_k + K_1/2]$  
   
   (How does this differ from Heun's method?)
1. 4th-order Runge-Kutta Method: 
   
   $u_{k+1} = u_k + (K_1 + 2K_2 + 2K_3 + K_4)/6$, 
   
   $K_1 = \Delta t\,f[t_k,u_k]$, 
   
   $K_2 = \Delta t\, f[t_k + \Delta t/2, u_k + K_1/2]$, 
   
   $K_3 = \Delta t\, f[t_k + \Delta t/2, u_k + K_2/2]$, 
   
   $K_4 = \Delta t\,f[t_k + \Delta t, u_k + K_3]$  
   
   (Note that final increment is a weighted average of four different increments - what is each doing? Why do you suppose the middle increments are more heavily weighted?)

In practice, the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method is the most popular method for integrating ODEs, since it nicely balances the precision per time step with the total number of required computations.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

This assignment helped me to pick apart the details of the methods used to integrate ODEs and discover through assessment which of the methods were the most accurate or popular. I found the 4th order to be the most useful integrator.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:
